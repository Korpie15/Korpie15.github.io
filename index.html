                    In AI in Robotics my group project was to program an AI model that could play tetris. We successfully achieved this goal. 
                    The Tetris AI project uses Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and reinforcement learning to optimize gameplay. The AI evaluates the best moves based on board metadata, enabling it to plan for combos like "Tetris clears" while minimizing gaps and towers. It generalizes well across board sizes, such as a 30x20 grid, despite training exclusively on a standard 10x20 grid. By analyzing final states instead of individual moves, the model achieves efficient, adaptable, and high-performing gameplay.

                <h3>Control Systems Engineer (2.5 Years)</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the past two and a half years, I have worked as a control systems engineer, gaining hands-on experience in programming automated warehousing systems and manufacturing lines. My responsibilities included PLC programming, troubleshooting, and commissioning industrial automation lines, with a focus on improving efficiency and reliability.
                    In this role I have learnt from those around me regarding becoming a professional engineer as well as being able to grow my technical skills through practical experience and my soft skills through observing of those around me and hands on activities such as running meetings and proposing crucial design changes.

                <h3>Pack Turning Cell</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the projects I worked on from inital programming to commissioning and handover to a customer was the Pack Turning Cell. This was my first project where I was the only one involved from the control side. 
                    The automation cell was added onto an existing manufacturing line. When this manufactuirng line is run one style of product being made is only laminated on one side and is required to be flipped for storage and trasportation to prevent bowing of the board. This pack turning cell is desinged to do just that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This project I learnt the importance of communication and collaboration between teams whilst learning significantly about drives, motors and the different types of sensors. Notable experiences were going away to site to commission the line for multiple days and the learning of all different machine safe standards which I had to adhere to and implement such as light curtains and estops as well as how to communuicate these safe status' between multiple lines using different plc's.
                    During the commissioning process I learnt the value of perseverance. There were many times where something was not working as it was supposed to. Sometimes this was as little as a typo all the way to the plc loosing values during a power cycle causing all sensors to loose their calibration causing packs to act unexpectedly and sometimes even crash and cause damage. Due to failing to have some interlocking conditions on the drives of some cross transfer conveyors I managed to wipe out a fence, a light curtain, a sensor and two sensor brackets and causing my line to be down for two days resulting in packs needing to be manually flipped.
                    Luckily with the help of on site fitters and sparkies this did not cause any delay in production and I was able to adjust my code and the line was opereational again in time for the next time single sidded boards were run.
