        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

        <div class="professional-project">
            <h3>Control Systems Engineer (3.5 Years)</h3>
            <p>
                Over the past three and a half years, I have worked as a Control Systems Engineer, gaining hands-on experience across multiple industrial automation projects. My work has involved <strong>PLC programming using Siemens TIA Portal</strong>, <strong>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)</strong>, and the <strong>integration and programming of Fanuc industrial robots</strong>. I have contributed to the design, programming, troubleshooting, and commissioning of automated warehousing systems and manufacturing lines, with a focus on improving reliability and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this role, I have developed both technical and professional competencies, particularly in managing multiple concurrent projects and maintaining structured documentation. Tracking tasks and documenting design decisions have allowed seamless transitions between projects and improved collaboration during handovers. Guidance from experienced colleagues has also helped refine my documentation and workflow practices, improving both technical clarity and project efficiency.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="professional-project">
            <h3>Industrial Robot Programming and Integration</h3>
            <p>
                My most recent work involved programming a <strong>Fanuc robot</strong> for use as a glut-handling robot on a strapping line at a new factory. The robot was designed to pick gluts from a stillage and place them into a stripper channel for reuse in packaging operations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for programming the robot’s pick, place, and scanning sequences to detect glut locations within the stillage, as well as configuring <strong>communication between the robot and the Siemens PLC via Profinet</strong>. I performed <strong>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)</strong> within the factory, verified motion sequences, and troubleshot integration issues between the robot, PLC, and line control systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project strengthened my understanding of <strong>industrial robotics, vision-based detection, and robot–PLC communication protocols</strong>. It also reinforced the importance of structured testing, clear fault diagnosis, and collaboration across engineering disciplines during commissioning.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="professional-project">
            <h3>Pack Turning Cell</h3>
            <p>
                One of the projects I completed from initial programming through to commissioning and customer handover was the Pack Turning Cell. This automation cell was added onto an existing manufacturing line to automatically flip one-sided laminated boards to prevent bowing during storage and transport. This was the first project where I was solely responsible for the control system.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project, I gained extensive experience with <strong>drives, motors, and sensors</strong>, as well as practical understanding of <strong>machine safety standards</strong> including the implementation of light curtains and emergency stop systems. I also worked on <strong>multi-PLC communication</strong> to safely coordinate between production lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commissioning presented several challenges that required patience and problem-solving. From debugging minor logic errors to recovering sensor calibration losses caused by PLC memory faults, each issue provided valuable lessons in troubleshooting under pressure. Despite an incident that resulted in damage to a safety fence and light curtain, corrective actions and collaboration with on-site teams ensured the line was restored without impacting production. The experience emphasised the value of perseverance, strong documentation, and clear communication during live commissioning.

                    I am in my fifth and final year of my Mechatronics Undergraduate degree. Throughout my degree, I have had the pleasure of working on varying projects. Some of my most proud ones are listed below.

                <h3>Turtle Bot Warehousing system</h3>
                <p>
                    The Turtlebot warehousing robot autonomis item picking and delivery in warehouses using a scalable system of robots. Initially, a single robot maps the warehouse, creating a static map while avoiding dynamic obstacles like people or forklifts. The system assigns tasks to robots based on proximity and payload capacity, coordinating item retrieval and delivery to a drop-off zone. Using lidar, the robots dynamically avoid obstacles, including each other, to maintain efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My focus was on the payload delivery system, a 3D-printed mechanism with a servo-driven trap door. Mounted on the top of the robot, it securely carries and dispenses items from the pick-up to the drop-off zone. Controlled by an Arduino Nano that listens for a signal from the Raspberry Pi the turtle bot is running on. By being mounted above the Lidar the system minimises interference with the lidar for smooth operation.

                <h3>Robotics Control Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involved simulating a robotic system with two robots, one of which required designing both its physical and kinematic models. The system was tasked with performing a pick, place, and sorting operation to organise blocks by colour. This included a GUI, obstacle detection, and a physical emergency stop button that worked in both simulation and on real hardware. A RealSense camera was used for vision, providing both colour and depth data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of robotics mathematics, including kinematics and singularity errors. This insight connected theory to my practical experience as a control systems engineer, where I had recently encountered similar challenges with Fanuc robots. Learning the theory behind why robot joints cannot align straight, to avoid singularity errors, was particularly valuable as it directly addressed a real-world problem I had faced.

                <h3>AI Tetris</h3>
                <p>
                    In AI in Robotics, my group project was to program an AI model that could play Tetris. We successfully achieved this goal. 
                    The Tetris AI project uses Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and reinforcement learning to optimise gameplay. The AI evaluates the best moves based on board metadata, enabling it to plan for combos like "Tetris clears" while minimizing gaps and towers. It generalises well across board sizes, such as a 30x20 grid, despite training exclusively on a standard 10x20 grid. By analyzing final states instead of individual moves, the model achieves efficient, adaptable, and high-performing gameplay.

                <h3>SPOT search and resuce</h3>
                <p>
                    This group project involved leveraging the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot for search-and-rescue operations in challenging and potentially hazardous environments. We developed a ROS1 package to facilitate autonomous exploration and human detection, making the system accessible for anyone to install and use. The onboard video feed from SPOT was integrated with YOLOv3 for human identification, achieving a confidence threshold of 80%. Since the pre-trained human detection model met our needs, no additional model training was required. When a human was detected, a marker was placed on a global map, allowing rescuers to pinpoint their exact locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exploration of the environment utilised a greedy frontier-based algorithm, ensuring complete area coverage. Once SPOT finished exploring, the total number of markers on the map provided the rescue team with a clear overview of all detected individuals and their locations.

                    This project was also a significant learning experience for me. It marked my first exposure to ROS, Linux, and Git repositories, helping me build confidence in installing and integrating different packages into robotic projects. These new skills have expanded my technical capabilities and prepared me for future projects.

                <h3>THOR Robotic Build</h3>
                <p>
                    As a part of the Mechanical and Mechatronic Society, a society build project that I was the events director and organiser for was the THOR robot build. This is an open-source robot build that we thought would be a great initiative for our members. The project would allow our society to own a robot that we could show off at open days but through the process of building it weekly, we could meet and interact with more of our members and create a greater sense of community.

            <h2>Teamwork and Service</h2>
            <p>
                Collaboration has been fundamental to my success in academic, professional, and leadership capacities. Across various roles, I have demonstrated exceptional interpersonal and organizational skills to achieve team objectives. Key aspects of my teamwork experience include:   
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coordinating Multidisciplinary Teams: Successfully leading diverse teams to achieve shared goals by leveraging individual strengths and fostering collaboration</li>
                <li>Encouraging Open Communication: Promoting a culture of transparency and problem-solving to address complex challenges effectively.</li>
                <li>Mentoring Team Members: Sharing knowledge and guiding peers in leadership and technical skills.</li>
                <li>Fostering Continuous Learning: Creating an environment where team members feel supported and motivated to grow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            In my role as the founder and president of UTSMechSoc, teamwork was the backbone of our success. I managed work distribution based on individual strengths, resolved conflicts, and collaborated with other societies to organise impactful events that benefit the student experience. I also led a small team as SUO2 of Training in the cadets, where we oversaw the execution of a comprehensive training program for the over 300 person unit.
            </p>
            <p>
            In my professional career, teamwork has been pivotal in the successful completion of projects. Whether initiating projects for others to deliver, collaborating with multiple individuals on overlapping tasks, or ensuring seamless integration across sections of a manufacturing line, I consistently emphasised effective communication and equitable work distribution to achieve results.
