# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Engineering ePortfolio

## Project Overview
This is a personal engineering portfolio website for Aidan Korpar, hosted on GitHub Pages. The site showcases professional experience, leadership, academic experience, teamwork, and capabilities.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static site)
- **No build process**: Direct HTML/CSS/JS files served as-is

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main portfolio page with all sections
- `style.css` - All styling for the portfolio
- `images/` - Portfolio images and assets
- `pdfs/` - Resume and other downloadable documents
- `favicon.png` - Site favicon

## Coding Standards

### HTML

- Use flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts
- Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
- Keep styles organized by section

### JavaScript
- Keep JavaScript minimal and vanilla (no frameworks)
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Add appropriate event listeners for interactive elements

## Design Guidelines
- Maintain professional appearance suitable for an engineering portfolio
- Ensure consistent color scheme and typography
- Keep navigation intuitive and accessible
- Optimize images for web (performance matters)
- Test responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Accessibility Requirements
- Provide alt text for all images
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios
- Support keyboard navigation
- Include ARIA labels where appropriate

## Content Guidelines
- Portfolio content should be professional and relevant to engineering
- Keep personal information (email, phone, LinkedIn) up to date
- Ensure all links are functional
- PDF documents should be accessible and downloadable

## Testing & Validation
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Validate HTML using W3C validator
- Check responsive design at various breakpoints
- Test all navigation links and interactive elements
- Verify PDF downloads work correctly

## Best Practices
- Keep code clean and well-commented where necessary
- Optimize for page load speed
- Ensure SEO-friendly markup
- Use descriptive file names for images and assets
- Maintain git history with clear commit messages

## When Making Changes
- Always preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
- Test changes locally before committing
