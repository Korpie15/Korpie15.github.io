        <!-- Professional Experience Section -->

            <h2 class="section-title">Professional Experience</h2>
            <h3>Control Systems Engineer (Since July 2022)</h3>
            <p>
                Since July 2022, I have worked as a Control Systems Engineer, gaining hands-on experience across multiple industrial automation projects. My work has involved <strong>PLC programming using Siemens TIA Portal</strong>, <strong>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)</strong>, and the <strong>integration and programming of Fanuc industrial robots</strong>. I have contributed to the design, programming, troubleshooting, and commissioning of automated warehousing systems and manufacturing lines, with a focus on improving reliability and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this role, I have developed both technical and professional competencies, particularly in managing multiple concurrent projects and maintaining structured documentation. Tracking tasks and documenting design decisions have allowed seamless transitions between projects and improved collaboration during handovers. Guidance from experienced colleagues has also helped refine my documentation and workflow practices, improving both technical clarity and project efficiency.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Industrial Robot Programming and Integration</h3>
            <p>
                My most recent work involved programming a <strong>Fanuc robot</strong> for use as a glut-handling robot on a strapping line at a new factory. The robot was designed to pick gluts from a stillage and place them into a stripper channel for reuse in packaging operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for programming the robot's pick, place, and scanning sequences to detect glut locations within the stillage, as well as configuring <strong>communication between the robot and the Siemens PLC via Profinet</strong>. I performed <strong>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)</strong> within the factory, verified motion sequences, and troubleshot integration issues between the robot, PLC, and line control systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project strengthened my understanding of <strong>industrial robotics, vision-based detection, and robotâ€“PLC communication protocols</strong>. It also reinforced the importance of structured testing, clear fault diagnosis, and collaboration across engineering disciplines during commissioning.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Pack Turning Cell</h3>
            <p>
                One of the projects I completed from initial programming through to commissioning and customer handover was the Pack Turning Cell. This automation cell was added onto an existing manufacturing line to automatically flip one-sided laminated boards to prevent bowing during storage and transport. This was the first project where I was solely responsible for the control system.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project, I gained extensive experience with <strong>drives, motors, and sensors</strong>, as well as practical understanding of <strong>machine safety standards</strong> including the implementation of light curtains and emergency stop systems. I also worked on <strong>multi-PLC communication</strong> to safely coordinate between production lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commissioning presented several challenges that required patience and problem-solving. From debugging minor logic errors to recovering sensor calibration losses caused by PLC memory faults, each issue provided valuable lessons in troubleshooting under pressure. Despite an incident that resulted in damage to a safety fence and light curtain, corrective actions and collaboration with on-site teams ensured the line was restored without impacting production. The experience emphasised the value of perseverance, strong documentation, and clear communication during live commissioning.

            <h3>Founder, Events Director, and President of UTSMechSoc</h3>
            <p>
                During my time at university, I founded UTS MechSoc after identifying a gap in student engagement within mechanical engineering. The society attracted over 400 members in its first year. I led the creation of major initiatives such as an industry networking night with over 300 attendees, strengthening relationships between students and industry professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the President, I led a 20-member executive team focused on sustainable growth and deeper engagement. Under my leadership, membership grew by <strong>42%</strong> from 418 to <strong>595</strong>, with a healthy <strong>22%</strong> retention rate. We ran <strong>62 events</strong> with a combined reach of over <strong>500 unique registrants</strong> and an average of <strong>51 attendees per event</strong>, maintaining a strong <strong>97%</strong> UTS student participation rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I emphasised collaboration, strategic planning, and member development, ensuring every executive had defined responsibilities aligned with their strengths. These efforts built a culture of accountability and innovation, reflected in consistently high event attendance, balanced engagement across activities, and long-term member loyalty.
            </p>
            <p>
                This role refined my leadership, stakeholder engagement, and data-driven decision-making skills, which have proven essential in guiding teams toward measurable impact in my professional career.

            <h2 class="section-title">Personal Projects and Academic Experience</h2>
            
            <div class="project-item">
                <h4>Professional ePortfolio Website</h4>
                <p>This professional ePortfolio website represents a modern approach to web development, combining traditional programming skills with cutting edge AI collaboration tools. The project showcases my ability to effectively leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-assisted development workflows to create a polished, responsive web presence.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout the development process, I utilised multiple AI platforms including <strong>ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude</strong> to explore different design approaches, troubleshoot issues, and refine the user experience. Each LLM brought unique strengths to the project, from generating initial HTML/CSS structures to optimising responsive layouts and suggesting best practices for web accessibility.</p>
                
                <p>A key aspect of this project was my experience with <strong>GitHub Copilot's agent-based workflow</strong>. Rather than simply accepting code suggestions, I approached the development process as a project manager, assigning specific tasks and roles to AI agents, reviewing their proposed changes, and iteratively refining the output. This workflow involved task delegation (breaking down complex features into specific, well-defined tasks), code review (critically evaluating AI-generated code for quality and maintainability), iterative refinement (providing feedback to achieve desired outcomes), and version control (managing changes through Git).</p>
                
                <p>The project enhanced my skills in <strong>web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)</strong>, <strong>responsive design principles</strong>, <strong>UI/UX considerations</strong>, and <strong>Git version control</strong>. By treating AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement for critical thinking, I developed a workflow that maximises productivity while maintaining high code quality and design standards.</p>
                
                <p>This experience has prepared me for the evolving landscape of software development, where the ability to effectively collaborate with AI tools is becoming as important as traditional programming skills. It demonstrates my adaptability, project management capabilities, and understanding of how to leverage emerging technologies to deliver professional results.</p>
                
                <p>I place strong emphasis on attention to detail throughout design and implementation. The site follows a mobile-first approach and has been tested across major mobile browsers to ensure responsive layouts, readable typography, accessible navigation, and correct image handling on small screens. For users who prefer a paper copy, the site includes print controls that automatically expand all content and ensure photos are included for offline review.</p>

                <h4>Turtle Bot Warehousing System</h4>
                <p>The Turtlebot warehousing robot enables autonomous item picking and delivery in warehouses using a scalable system of robots. Initially, a single robot maps the warehouse, creating a static map while avoiding dynamic obstacles like people or forklifts. The system assigns tasks to robots based on proximity and payload capacity, coordinating item retrieval and delivery to a drop-off zone. Using lidar, the robots dynamically avoid obstacles, including each other, to maintain efficiency.</p>
                
                <p>My focus was on the payload delivery system, a 3D-printed mechanism with a servo-driven trap door. Mounted on the top of the robot, it securely carries and dispenses items from the pick-up to the drop-off zone. Controlled by an Arduino Nano that listens for a signal from the Raspberry Pi the turtle bot is running on, the system is mounted above the Lidar to minimise interference with navigation sensors for smooth operation.</p>
                
                <p>This project provided hands-on experience with <strong>ROS (Robot Operating System)</strong>, <strong>autonomous navigation algorithms</strong>, <strong>sensor integration</strong>, and <strong>mechanical design for robotics</strong>. It demonstrated the practical application of combining software control systems with custom hardware solutions to solve real-world warehouse automation challenges.</p>

                <h4>Robotics Control Project</h4>
                <p>This project involved simulating a robotic system with two robots, one of which required designing both its physical and kinematic models. The system was tasked with performing a pick, place, and sorting operation to organise blocks by colour. This included a GUI, obstacle detection, and a physical emergency stop button that worked in both simulation and on real hardware. A RealSense camera was used for vision, providing both colour and depth data.</p>
                
                <p>Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of robotics mathematics, including <strong>kinematics and singularity errors</strong>. This insight connected theory to my practical experience as a control systems engineer, where I had recently encountered similar challenges with Fanuc robots. Learning the theory behind why robot joints cannot align straight, to avoid singularity errors, was particularly valuable as it directly addressed a real-world problem I had faced.</p>
                
                <p>The project involved implementing <strong>forward and inverse kinematics</strong>, developing <strong>computer vision algorithms for object detection and colour sorting</strong>, creating safety systems with emergency stops, and integrating physical hardware with simulation environments. This comprehensive experience bridged the gap between theoretical robotics and practical implementation.</p>

                <h4>AI Tetris</h4>
                <p>In AI in Robotics, my group project was to program an AI model that could play Tetris. We successfully achieved this goal using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and reinforcement learning to optimise gameplay.</p>
                
                <p>The Tetris AI evaluates the best moves based on board metadata, enabling it to plan for combos like "Tetris clears" while minimising gaps and towers. It generalises well across board sizes, such as a 30x20 grid, despite training exclusively on a standard 10x20 grid. By analysing final states instead of individual moves, the model achieves efficient, adaptable, and high-performing gameplay.</p>
                
                <p>This project demonstrated practical application of <strong>deep learning</strong>, <strong>reinforcement learning techniques</strong>, <strong>neural network training</strong>, and <strong>game AI development</strong>. The AI's ability to generalise to different board sizes showcased the robustness of the trained model and the effectiveness of the state-based learning approach.</p>

                <h4>SPOT Search and Rescue</h4>
                <p>This group project involved leveraging the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot for search-and-rescue operations in challenging and potentially hazardous environments. We developed a ROS1 package to facilitate autonomous exploration and human detection, making the system accessible for anyone to install and use.</p>
                
                <p>The onboard video feed from SPOT was integrated with <strong>YOLOv3</strong> for human identification, achieving a confidence threshold of 80%. Since the pre-trained human detection model met our needs, no additional model training was required. When a human was detected, a marker was placed on a global map, allowing rescuers to pinpoint their exact locations.</p>
                
                <p>Exploration of the environment utilised a <strong>greedy frontier-based algorithm</strong>, ensuring complete area coverage. Once SPOT finished exploring, the total number of markers on the map provided the rescue team with a clear overview of all detected individuals and their locations.</p>
                
                <p>This project was also a significant learning experience for me. It marked my first exposure to <strong>ROS, Linux, and Git repositories</strong>, helping me build confidence in installing and integrating different packages into robotic projects. These new skills have expanded my technical capabilities and prepared me for future projects involving complex robotic systems and open-source collaboration.</p>
